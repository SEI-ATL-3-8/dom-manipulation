console.log('hello from script.js');

// Phase 1: selecting elements
// For each prompt, perform the specified selection. Save the result to a variable, then console.log that variable. Confirm that it contains what it should in the console!

// 1) All section tags
// 2) The first section tag
// 3) The element with an id of home-content
// 4) The element with an id of services-link
// 5) The first element with a class of nav-link
// 6) All elements with a class of nav-link



// Phase 2: adding event listeners
// Add an event listener to each of the nav links
// In the callback function of each listener, console.log which link was clicked


// Phase 3: 
// When a nav link is clicked,
// a) turn that link purple, and all other links blue
// b) reveal the section associated with that link, and hide all other sections. Hint: you might want to use the String.replace method to turn a string like home-link into home-content, which you can then use as an id selector

// Use the <whichever element>.classList.add and <whichever element>.classList.remove
